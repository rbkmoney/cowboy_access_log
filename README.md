## Description
This app implements apache-styled access logging for cowboy >= 2.0.  
It works as a `stream handler` and logs every request received by server via Logger.  
Following information is being logged:
* `status` - HTTP status code
* `remote_addr` - IP address of request origin if it was forwarded
* `peer_addr` - IP address of request origin
* `request_method` - Request method
* `request_path` -  Request path
* `request_length` - Request length
* `response_length` - Responce length
* `request_time` - Time taken by requset proccessing in Âµs
* `http_x-request-id` - Unique request id
## Usage
To use this stream handler just put it in stream handler chain when configuring cowboy server.
All log events, created by the handler are being taged with `cowboy_access_log` domain, so they can be easily filtered with built-in functions.
Check examples for better understanding.
## Examples
### Add handler
```
cowboy:start_clear(http, [{port, 8080}], #{
    stream_handlers => [cowboy_metrics_h, cowboy_stream_h],
    env => #{dispatch => Dispatch}
}).
```
### Filter only cowboy_access_log events
```
add_handler_filter(
    HandlerId,
    FilterId,
    {fun logger_filters:domain/2, {stop, not_equal, [cowboy_access_log]}}
).
```
